# My Portfolio Changed

### The second one!!

**Chirpy** is a **Jekyll** template that allows you to build iteractive sites quickly, just like this one here.

* If you have hosted a site on **Github pages**, you were actually using Jekyll.

* To get you started on the set up, I recommend using this [link](https://chirpy.cotes.page/). You will get a walk-through of the setup.

### Note
* If you deploy your site and all you see is something like
  * '---layout: index ---'
  * First, check that your repo name and the url for the site are the same.
  * If the above doesn't help...
  * I recommend returning to the original repo, click **template** then click **create new repo**. 
  * Before cloning it to your local computer, deploy it first and retry.

### Closing
This is the first blog and the quality should not be judged. If you got ideas/feedback, I'd love to hear it.
